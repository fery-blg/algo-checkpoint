Problem 1: Sum of Distinct Elements in Two Sets
    in the first problem you will find a solutiont for a sum of distinct elements by using array

problem2 : The second problem involves vector operations. It includes a procedure dot_product that calculates the dot (scalar) product of two vectors. Additionally, an algorithm is provided to determine whether two vectors are orthogonal. The dot product of two orthogonal vectors is zero.
